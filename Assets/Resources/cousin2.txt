Detective: “It seems you can’t be the culprit, though I assume you already know that.”
Cousin: “Does that mean I can go now?”
Detective: “Yes. If I need you again, I will call you back. One last thing, though. Do you know where your cousins are?”
Cousin: “Oh, they should be over in the dining room. That’s where I last saw them.”
Detective: “Thanks.”
